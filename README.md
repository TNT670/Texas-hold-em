# Texas-hold-em

Java application that hosts and plays a game of Texas hold 'em! (With animations!)

As Player 1, strategize and bet your way to the top of the table!

## TODOs: a work in progress!

As of now the core game logic should be sound, but some bugs may persist, especially with displaying and distributing pot prizes.

A (non-exhaustive) list of additions I would like to accomplish:

1. Resolve display issues with multiple side pots
2. Add a window title (easy, I know, but I'll get there!)
3. Add a title screen
4. Add the ability to input your name
5. Find and add images to represent increasingly larger piles of chips
6. Add a game over screen for when you win or lose
7. Additional customization options
8. Add the ability for multiple people to play in one table (ambitious, but totally doable!)
9. Squash any bugs that may come about

## Dependencies required

- Java JDK >= 1.8
- Ant >= 1.8

## Build instructions

1. Download and install the Java JDK version 1.8 or higher as well as Ant version 1.8 or higher, if not already installed on your system.
2. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Enter the command "ant clean jar". This will build the application. Once the build process is complete, a JAR file named "CardGameProject" will be created in the "dist" folder.
4. Run the jar file with "java -jar" or by double-clicking the JAR file through your system's file explorer.
